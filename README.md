# sign-up-form

It's a project I made while learning at The Odin Project.
Here I needed to make a simple sign up form, applying some customization as well as adding simple validation. 

The main difficulty for me was to make everything clean avoiding making one big mess. 
I'm trying to learn how to divide the task into small chunks dealing with them step by step, instead of rushing through the whole thing chaotically writing lines of code.
